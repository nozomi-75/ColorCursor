# ColorCursor

A simple script to download and convert Project Sekai cursor assets into a Linux-compatible theme. Inspired by rhythm games and virtual performances.

Special thanks to safeusernameig.

## Instructions

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nozomi-75/ColorCursor/refs/heads/main/ColorCursor-NG.sh
bash ColorCursor-NG.sh
```
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nozomi-75/ColorCursor/refs/heads/main/ColorCursor-NG.sh
bash ColorCursor-NG.sh
```

## Note

The PRJSK cursor assets are rather limited, at 17 items. This is rather stale in comparison to Linux's roughly 140, following [Yaru's](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru) practices. Therefore, it is expected that some assets are designated to fallback to PRJSK's Normal.

Thus, there may also be some asset mismatch. In event of such, please file an issue or a pull request. I'll try to act on it as soon as I can.
